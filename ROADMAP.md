# d-geospatial Roadmap

**Status:** Foundation complete; `geodesy-d` architecture starting  
**Scope:** Independent reusable D libraries only

## Objective

The goal of `d-geospatial` is to establish a small set of high-quality, independently useful D libraries for geometry, geodesy, spatial computing, raster processing and geospatial data.

The roadmap deliberately favours **depth before breadth**.

Libraries should not be created merely because a future application might need them.

A new package should appear only when:

- its domain is sufficiently understood;
- its boundaries can be stated clearly;
- it provides independent value;
- and there is enough real work to justify maintaining another repository.

# Phase 0 — Shared foundation

## Architecture and policy

- [x] Define workspace purpose.
- [x] Separate reusable libraries from applications.
- [x] Define independent repository model.
- [x] Define shared `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`.
- [x] Establish hardlink strategy for shared workspace documentation (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`).
- [x] Define repository naming policy.
- [x] Define D module namespace policy.
- [x] Define compiler policy.
- [x] Define licence strategy.
- [x] Define minimum CI/quality expectations.
- [x] Define the `geo-d` / `geodesy-d` / `georef-d` / `proj-d` responsibility boundary.
- [x] Finalise workspace `README.md`.
- [x] Finalise workspace `ROADMAP.md`.

## Agreed conventions

### Licence

```text
MIT
```

Each independent library repository carries its own MIT `LICENSE`.

### Naming

```text
Repository / DUB       Module root

geodesy-d              geodesy
geo-d                  geo
georef-d               georef
raster-d               raster
spatial-d              spatial
proj-d                  proj
gdal-d                  gdal
osm-d                   osm
```

### Compiler policy

Required:

```text
DMD
LDC
```

Best effort:

```text
GDC
```

CI normally follows current stable DMD and LDC releases.

Initial shared language baseline:

```text
D frontend 2.112.1
```

The language baseline advances when the required compiler matrix permits it.

### Minimum CI baseline

Every active library must support:

```text
dub test
```

CI should at minimum verify:

- DMD tests/build;
- LDC tests/build;
- LDC release build;
- expected repository/documentation structure.

Benchmarks, fuzzing, property tests and specialised interoperability tests are added according to the domain.

## Remaining workspace tooling

- [x] Implement `link-shared-docs.sh`.
- [ ] Implement `check-workspace.sh`.
- [ ] Implement `run-all-tests.sh`.
- [ ] Implement `run-all-benchmarks.sh`.
- [ ] Implement `show-status.sh`.

`check-workspace.sh` should eventually verify, where relevant:

- shared `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` hardlinks;
- required repository files;
- Git state;
- DUB package health;
- supported compiler availability;
- package/module naming consistency.

Phase 0 policy work is complete. Tooling may continue incrementally while library development begins.

# Phase 1 — Fundamental libraries

The first development wave should contain only libraries whose usefulness is broad and whose domain boundaries are reasonably clear.

Initial candidates:

```text
geodesy-d
geo-d
raster-d
spatial-d
```

They do not need to start simultaneously.

The first library should be selected according to the first concrete implementation task.


## `geodesy-d`

### Initial goal

Provide a small, dependency-light, pure-D foundation for geodetic mathematics without requiring the PROJ runtime for bounded mathematical operations.

### Initial scope

First vertical slice:

```text
Angle
Latitude
Longitude
Ellipsoid
GeodeticCoordinate
GeocentricCoordinate / ECEF
geodetic ↔ geocentric conversion
```

Subsequent scope, only after the core is verified:

```text
3-parameter geocentric translation
7-parameter Helmert transformation
Transverse Mercator
UTM
direct/inverse ellipsoidal geodesics
```

### Explicit boundary

`geodesy-d` owns mathematical operations whose semantics depend on the Earth, a reference ellipsoid, geographic/geocentric coordinates or a map projection.

It does **not** own:

- general Euclidean geometry or polygon topology;
- EPSG/authority databases;
- WKT or PROJJSON parsing;
- automatic CRS/transformation discovery;
- transformation grid management;
- MGRS, Geohash or Plus Code encodings.

Those responsibilities belong respectively to `geo-d`, `proj-d` and `georef-d`.

### Design questions

- scalar policy and supported floating-point types;
- angle storage and degree/radian construction semantics;
- latitude/longitude normalisation versus validation;
- canonical ellipsoid representation;
- coordinate value types and ellipsoidal-height / shared linear-unit semantics;
- error semantics for invalid/undefined inputs;
- numerical accuracy and convergence policy;
- `@safe`, `@nogc`, `nothrow` and CTFE expectations;
- reference-source and cross-validation policy.

### Reference hierarchy

For geodetic algorithms, prefer authoritative specifications and primary numerical references. Typical validation sources include:

1. IOGP / EPSG Guidance Note 7-2 and EPSG method definitions;
2. primary algorithm publications such as Karney where applicable;
3. GeographicLib as a trusted numerical reference for geodesics;
4. PROJ as an independent interoperability and cross-validation implementation.

### Architecture documentation

- [x] `docs/README.md` — library scope and documentation map.
- [x] ADR-0001 — scope and architectural boundaries.
- [ ] ADR-0002 — core type, unit, scalar, and ellipsoid model (proposed; open items remain).
- [x] `docs/REFERENCES.md` — reference and numerical-validation policy.

### Quality gates

Before a stable API:

- authoritative reference vectors for each operation;
- edge cases at poles, equator and longitude boundaries where applicable;
- forward/inverse round-trip tests;
- randomised cross-validation against trusted implementations where practical;
- explicit accuracy/error documentation;
- no broad `@fastmath` policy without algorithm-specific proof and benchmarks;
- compiler coverage with DMD and LDC.

## `geo-d`

### Initial goal

Provide a small, robust, coordinate-system-agnostic Euclidean geometry foundation suitable for GIS and non-GIS applications.

### Initial scope

Candidate types:

```text
Point2
Vector2
Bounds / Box
Segment
Polyline
LinearRing
Polygon
```

Candidate algorithms:

```text
distance
squared distance
nearest point
segment intersection
bounding box
orientation
signed area
point in polygon
polyline length
simplification
```

### Design questions

- coordinate and scalar genericity;
- point/vector semantics versus primitive coordinate types;
- geometry ownership versus geometry views;
- polygon/ring representation;
- numerical robustness;
- allocation policy;
- interoperability conventions.

### Quality gates

Before a stable API:

- extensive unit tests;
- degenerate-geometry tests;
- property tests where useful;
- numerical reference cases;
- performance baselines;
- documented complexity;
- memory/ownership documentation.

## `raster-d`

### Initial goal

Provide a reusable raster abstraction and a focused set of efficient raster-processing algorithms.

### Initial scope

Candidate concepts:

```text
RasterBuffer
RasterView
shape
strides
ROI
channel
pixel/layout description
```

Candidate operations:

```text
crop/view
copy
sampling
resize
normalisation
convolution
Gaussian blur
Sobel
Scharr
gradient magnitude
histogram
threshold
basic morphology
```

### Architecture questions

- multidimensional view representation;
- relationship to existing D numerical libraries;
- contiguous versus strided representations;
- channel-layout semantics;
- colour-space responsibilities;
- caller-provided output buffers;
- SIMD/vectorisation strategy;
- threading policy.

A generic multidimensional-array implementation should not be invented merely for this package if a suitable existing D abstraction can be used.

### Quality gates

- allocation behaviour documented per major operation;
- zero-copy operations tested as such;
- contiguous/strided correctness tests;
- benchmark suite for core kernels;
- large-raster tests;
- comparison against trusted numerical references.

## `spatial-d`

### Initial goal

Provide reusable high-performance spatial indexes and queries independent of GIS-specific object models.

### First step

Before writing a new index implementation:

- survey existing D spatial-index packages;
- audit their APIs and maintenance status;
- test correctness;
- benchmark representative workloads.

Reusing or improving an existing implementation is preferable when it meets the project standards.

### Possible scope

```text
Box
RTree
PackedRTree / STR tree
SpatialHash
nearest queries
intersection queries
bulk build
mutable updates
```

### Representative workloads

Benchmarks should include:

- 10³ objects;
- 10⁵ objects;
- 10⁶+ objects where practical;
- random distributions;
- clustered geographic distributions;
- viewport queries;
- nearest-object queries;
- update-heavy workloads.

# Phase 2 — Native geospatial integration

Only after the fundamental D-side abstractions are sufficiently understood should native integration packages solidify around them.

Candidates:

```text
proj-d
gdal-d
```

## `proj-d`

### Goal

Provide a small, idiomatic and safe D interface to PROJ.

### Candidate scope

```text
CRS
Transformation
forward()
inverse()
transform()
```

### Principles

- deterministic native-resource lifetime;
- raw C API available but isolated;
- no requirement for the basic geometry library itself to depend on PROJ;
- explicit coordinate semantics;
- preserve useful native error information.

### Exit criteria

- common EPSG transformations tested;
- round-trip numerical tests;
- thread-safety behaviour documented;
- native resource leaks tested.

## `gdal-d`

### Goal

Provide a modern D interface to GDAL without mechanically reproducing the entire upstream API.

### Initial raster scope

```text
Dataset
RasterBand
DatasetInfo
GeoTransform
CRS metadata
windowed reads
resampling
NoData
overview access
```

Particular emphasis should be placed on efficient reading into caller-owned memory where GDAL permits it.

### Later scope

Vector support may be added if justified by real consumers.

It should not be included merely for API completeness.

### Quality gates

- deterministic handle ownership;
- malformed/error-path tests;
- GeoTIFF test fixtures;
- windowed-I/O benchmarks;
- large-raster tests;
- no unnecessary intermediate copies in common workflows.

# Phase 3 — Geospatial domain libraries

Once the lower layers have proven themselves in real use, higher-level geospatial packages may be added.

Primary candidates:

```text
georef-d
osm-d
```


## `georef-d`

### Goal

Provide compact and discrete geographic reference/coding systems without turning them into CRS or geometry abstractions.

### Initial candidates

```text
MGRS
Geohash
Open Location Code / Plus Codes
```

MGRS may depend on the UTM implementation from `geodesy-d`. Geohash and Open Location Code should remain independent unless a real shared abstraction emerges.

### Important boundary

`georef-d` encodes or decodes geographic locations/references. It does not provide:

- address geocoding;
- a CRS/authority database;
- map projection infrastructure beyond what is consumed from `geodesy-d`;
- general Euclidean geometry.

No common `SpatialCode` interface should be introduced merely because several encodings live in the same package; common abstractions must be earned through real reuse.

## `osm-d`

### Goal

Provide efficient reusable OpenStreetMap data and format support.

### Initial scope

```text
Node
Way
Relation
Tag
Member
Object metadata
```

Formats:

```text
OSM XML
OSM PBF
```

Later, if justified:

```text
OSC
OSM API interaction
```

### Performance objectives

Large OSM datasets should not require one independently heap-allocated class object per primitive.

The design should investigate:

- compact storage;
- streaming;
- block-oriented processing;
- dense-node decoding;
- parallel decompression;
- callback/sink APIs;
- optional materialisation.

### Important boundary

`osm-d` must not become an editor framework.

Excluded from the core library:

- GUI;
- rendering;
- toolbars;
- editing modes;
- presets UI;
- application state.

Reusable OSM validation or editing primitives may become separate modules or libraries only when independent value has been demonstrated.

# Phase 4 — Advanced reusable algorithms

Some algorithms motivated by geospatial editing may eventually justify independent libraries.

Candidate:

```text
smarttrace-d
```

This phase is intentionally conditional.

## `smarttrace-d`

### Admission requirement

The package should only be created if tracing functionality can be formulated as a genuinely reusable algorithmic library.

Possible general model:

```text
cost field
    +
start
    +
target
    +
constraints
        ↓
candidate path
        +
confidence/evidence
```

Potential components:

```text
A*
Dijkstra
Live Wire
edge-derived cost fields
curvature penalties
multi-source cost fusion
confidence estimation
```

Raster-specific preprocessing may belong in `raster-d`.

OSM-specific interpretation should remain outside the generic tracing core.

If the functionality remains specific to one editor, `smarttrace-d` should not be created.

# Phase 5 — Maturity

Libraries approaching general public usefulness should graduate through explicit maturity levels.

Suggested informal states:

```text
experimental
development
stable
mature
```

These states are descriptive and independent of Semantic Versioning.

## Stable-library expectations

A stable library should have:

- documented public API;
- clear ownership and error semantics;
- Ddoc coverage;
- realistic examples;
- test suite;
- regression tests;
- representative benchmarks where performance matters;
- CI for supported compilers;
- changelog;
- documented minimum compiler version;
- semantic versioning;
- migration notes for breaking releases.

# Cross-library priorities

## Safety

Progressively increase useful:

```text
@safe
const
immutable
scope
return
```

coverage.

Unsafe FFI and low-level memory code should remain small and reviewable.

## Performance

Maintain performance baselines before aggressive optimisation.

Relevant metrics may include:

```text
latency
throughput
allocations
memory usage
scaling
```

## Fuzzing

Prioritise fuzzing for:

- file-format decoders;
- binary parsers;
- geometry edge cases;
- raster dimensions and offsets;
- native interoperability boundaries.

## Documentation

Architectural decisions should be recorded while the reasoning is still known.

Do not rely on commit history to explain important design choices.

## Real consumers

Library APIs should be exercised by real programs.

A demanding consuming application is valuable because it exposes:

- awkward APIs;
- hidden allocation;
- ownership mistakes;
- scaling problems;
- missing abstractions.

Application requirements may motivate libraries but must not dictate application-specific public APIs.

# Things deliberately not planned

`d-geospatial` currently does **not** aim to develop:

- a GUI toolkit;
- a general application framework;
- a logging framework;
- a dependency-injection system;
- a new general-purpose multidimensional-array framework;
- a replacement for GDAL;
- a full replacement for PROJ's CRS/authority/grid infrastructure;
- a general machine-learning framework;
- a monolithic GIS SDK.

If a mature external project solves the difficult part well, interoperability is preferred.

# Near-term sequence

The current intended sequence is:

```text
1. Shared foundation                         DONE
       ↓
2. geodesy-d architecture and core           CURRENT
       ↓
3. Verify geodetic core against references
       ↓
4. Extend geodesy-d only through validated operations
       ↓
5. Start geo-d / raster-d / spatial-d as concrete work justifies
       ↓
6. Add proj-d / gdal-d native integration
       ↓
7. Add georef-d and other domain libraries when their dependencies are stable
```

The first active library is therefore `geodesy-d`. Its first implementation milestone is deliberately limited to angle/coordinate/ellipsoid types and geodetic ↔ geocentric conversion.

`geo-d`, `raster-d` and `spatial-d` remain first-wave libraries, but their exact order should be driven by concrete technical work rather than by this roadmap.

# Success criterion

`d-geospatial` succeeds if its libraries become useful **even to D developers who have no interest in the application that originally motivated them**.

The intended result is not one large geospatial product.

It is a set of independent D libraries that are individually worth using.
